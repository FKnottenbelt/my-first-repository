# array_diff.rb 6 kyu

# Your goal in this kata is to implement an difference function, which subtracts
# one list from another.

# It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

# array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

# If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the
# other:

# array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]


def array_diff(a, b)
 a.delete_if { |ael| b.include?(ael)}
end

p array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
p array_diff([1,2], [1]) == [2] # "a was [1,2], b was [1], expected [2]")
p array_diff([1,2,2], [1]) == [2,2] #  "a was [1,2,2], b was [1], expected [2,2]")
p array_diff([1,2,2], [2]) == [1] # "a was [1,2,2], b was [2], expected [1]")
p array_diff([1,2,2], []) == [1,2,2] # "a was [1,2,2], b was [], expected [1,2,2]")
p array_diff([], [1,2]) == [] #  "a was [], b was [1,2], expected []")
